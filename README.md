# intsort

Most people rely on v8's native functions to perform the most efficient common operations. Because the exposed C/C++ procedures are often very performant, we sometimes take for granted our inability to write code that is faster. For certain common problems, we can use more specific solutions that do not require the generality provided by an abstract comparison sort like quicksort, heapsort, and mergesort.
